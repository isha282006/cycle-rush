  <h2>About Cycle Rush</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Cycle Rush</strong> is a smart and eco-friendly cycle rental system
    designed specially for university campuses. Our goal is to provide students
    and staff with a fast, affordable, and green way to move around.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of using bikes, autos, or walking long distances, users can simply
    book a cycle through Cycle Rush and reach their destination quickly and
    comfortably.
  </p>

  <p>
    This system reduces pollution, saves money, and promotes a healthy lifestyle.
    It also helps in reducing traffic inside the campus.
